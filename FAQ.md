# Fastlane Bot FAQ

### **1. Identifying and Executing Arbitrage Opportunities with the Fastlane Bot**
- **Question:** How does the Fastlane Bot identify and execute arbitrage opportunities?
- **Answer:** The bot searches for arbitrage opportunities between DEXes. When it finds an opportunity, the bot submits a transaction to the Fast Lane contract, which takes a flashloan and subsequently executes trades that close the arbitrage opportunity.

### **2. Using a Private Node or Infura with the Fastlane Bot**
- **Question:** Can a private node or Infura be used with the Fastlane Bot?
- **Answer:** Yes. The bot can use any RPC. This can be edited in the fastlane_bot/config/providers file - search for: self.RPC_URL. Note that some functions require an Alchemy API key, making it necessary unless the functions themselves are modified. These functions are in fastlane_bot/helpers/txhelpers, and include get_access_list, submit_private_transaction, and get_max_priority_fee_per_gas_alchemy.

### **3. Arbitraging Specific Tokens using the Fastlane Bot**
- **Question:** How can I search for arbitrage for specific tokens using the Fastlane Bot?
- **Answer:** The bot includes two Click Options - flashloan_tokens & target_tokens - that enable searching only pools that include specific tokens. 

### **4. Tax Token Handling in the Fastlane Bot**
- **Question:** Can the bot trade tax tokens?
- **Answer:** No. The bot currently does not support tax tokens.

### **5. Fastlane Bot as a Web Application**
- **Question:** Can the Fastlane Bot operate as a web application?
- **Answer:** The Fastlane Bot is not designed as a web app. It functions as a backend framework for identifying and executing arbitrage trades using the Fast Lane smart contract on the blockchain.

### **6. Addressing 'Gas Required Exceeds Allowance' Error in the Fastlane Bot**
- **Question:** What steps should be taken if the bot displays a 'gas required exceeds allowance' error during transaction building?
- **Answer:** This error can have several causes, the most common of which is simply that the transaction is expected to revert. Another cause of this can be not having enough ETH on the address used by the bot to execute transactions. 

### **7. Addressing 'Reverted SafeMath: subtraction overflow' Error in the Fastlane Bot**
- **Question:** I see the error: "Reverted SafeMath: subtraction overflow" when my bot tries to build a transaction, what's wrong?
- **Answer:** This typically happens due to the a tax token being included in the arbitrage route. Tax tokens are not supported by the bot and transactions that include them will typically fail.  

# How to Make your Bot more Competitive

## Overview

Typically only one bot-operator is able to close each arbitrage opportunity, making bot operation competitive in nature. The purpose of this document is to provide ideas on ways to improve your own bot.

### Gas Priority Fee Optimization
In config/network.py there is a constant: DEFAULT_GAS_PRICE_OFFSET. This is a multiplier that increases the priority fee paid by your TX. The higher it is, the more likely your TX will get executed, but the more the TX costs. Itâ€™s set to increase by 9% by default, which is likely insufficient to be competitive. You could also design a custom function to modify the priority fee based on profit - this could likely make you competitive, but would require some work.

### Data Throughput
Faster data means faster cycles for the arbitrage bot. The easiest way to achieve this is by using a premium plan from a data provider such as Alchemy.

Another way to achieve this is by running an Ethereum node locally. The bot can be connected to a local Ethereum node fairly easily by changing the RPC_URL in the fastlane_bot/config/providers file. Note that some functions require an Alchemy API key, making Alchemy necessary unless the functions themselves are modified.

These functions are in fastlane_bot/helpers/txhelpers, and include:
* **get_access_list:** this function is optional - using it saves around 5000 gas on average per transaction.
* **submit_private_transaction:** this function is not optional, however it's possible to submit transactions directly to Flashbots. See the Flashbots Documentation for more details: https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint
* **get_max_priority_fee_per_gas_alchemy:** this function is not optional, but could be replaced with custom priority fee logic.

### New Arbitrage Modes
Currently the bot is geared towards closing pariwise & triangular arbitrage on Bancor V3 & Carbon, but it can easily be generalized for all the exchanges it supports. To do this, you would need to create a new Arb Mode file, and design the combinations that are fed into the Optimizer. A lot of the heavy lifting here is already handled, but there may be a few specific changes you would need to make to get it to work.
